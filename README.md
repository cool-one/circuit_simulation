# circuit_simulation

The idea for this program came to me after I watched part of a video about how computers add numbers.  I was curious as to how adding numbers could be physically implemented using a circuit.  While watching, it struck me that this was something I could actually simulate using object-oriented programming, with circuits being the objects.  Tutorial-free, all code is original.

In its current state, the program is run on the command line.  It will prompt the user for 2 10-digit binary numbers and return the sum in 11-digit form to account for a possible carry-over.
